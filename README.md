# Cryptocurrency-Price-Tracker
A price tracking tool for multiple Cryptocurrencies

This tool is used to gather price data on Cryptocurrencies and the change in price over the past 24 hours. I would like the tool to be able to convert these Cryptocurrencies to each major world currency. 

The program that I am using as a basis for my tool is https://github.com/austindavissmith/CryptoTracker this tracker has many of the features I hoped to add. I expect to go into this program and draw inspiration and technique for coding my program to make it function properly.
